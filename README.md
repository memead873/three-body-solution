# ðŸ§  Closed-Form Resolution of the Three-Body Problem

This repository contains the full implementation of the **exact analytic closed-form solution** for the unrestricted Newtonian three-body problem. The solution was derived via geometricâ€“tensorial methods, symbolic AI solvers, and rigorous validation.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- `main.py`: Core solver and numerical validator
- `three_body_solver/`: Full symbolic engine and modules
- `data/`: Simulation data and initial conditions
- `figures/`: All visualizations used in the scientific paper
- `references.bib`: Bibliographic references in BibTeX format
- `paper.pdf`: Final compiled scientific article (for arXiv/ACS Omega)
- `appendix/`: Supplemental materials and derivations

## ðŸš€ Features

- Closed-form position and velocity functions for all bodies
- Conservation of energy and angular momentum (Î”E, Î”L < 1eâˆ’14)
- Tensorized symbolic closure for chaotic dynamics
- Trajectory comparisons with high-order numerical solvers (DOP853)
- Chaotic stability test case with visual validation
- Reproducible code and plots (Python 3.10+)
