## 📖 Overview

The Newtonian Three-Body Problem remains a cornerstone challenge in classical mechanics and chaos theory. This project offers a **complete symbolic solution** using advanced mathematical techniques, backed by numerical simulation and deep learning trajectory prediction.

The work aims to bridge:
- Analytic methods (Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, and variational solutions)
- Adaptive numerical solvers
- Machine learning (LSTM, Fourier-based networks)

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ **Closed-form Symbolic Solution**  
  Using tensorial calculus, geometric mechanics, and sympy derivation tools.

- ✅ **Numerical Simulations**  
  Adaptive integration (e.g., Dormand–Prince 8th-order) for comparison and validation.

- ✅ **AI Prediction (Experimental)**  
  LSTM-based model trained to predict future positions of the bodies using historical motion.

- ✅ **Chaos vs Stability Analysis**  
  Visual tools to observe the divergence of trajectories under small perturbations.

🧠 AI Module Details

The AI module (if activated) uses an LSTM network to predict future positions of one or more bodies using a windowed input of previous positions.

Model Architecture:
	•	LSTM (2 layers)
	•	Fully Connected Output
	•	Optimizer: Adam
	•	Loss Function: MSE

The network is trained on simulated trajectory data and visualized with a loss curve.
